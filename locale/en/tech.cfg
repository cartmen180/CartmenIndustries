[technology-description]
basic-metals=By separating copper and iron we can start producing more advanced materials.
tin-lead=Tin and Lead are much needed materials in electronics and ammunition production.
precious-metals=Gold and Silver are required in advanced electronics.
basic-metal-casting=The ability to make plates out of ores is a significant step forward.
tin-lead-smelting=The ability to make plates out of ores is a significant step forward.
ore-crushing=The crushing of ores allows us to purify it even further.
iron-casting=A more advanced and efficient way to produce iron.

copper-casting=A more advanced and efficient way to produce copper.
copper-flotation=Froth Flotation is a process for selectively separating hydrophobic materials from hydrophilic materials. 
copper-smelting=Melting the copper and then adding chemicals allows for a much purer copper.
copper-refining=The latest copper refining techniques are used to create 99.99% pure copper.

tin-flotation=Froth Flotation is a process for selectively separating hydrophobic materials from hydrophilic materials. 
tin-casting=The latest tin refining techniques are used to create 99.99% pure tin.

lead-flotation=Froth Flotation is a process for selectively separating hydrophobic materials from hydrophilic materials. 
lead-casting=The latest lead refining techniques are used to create 99.99% pure lead.

steel-casting=The latest steel refining techniques are used to create a very strong and durable steel.

ci-electronics=Electronics deals with electrical circuits that involve active electrical components such as vacuum tubes, transistors, diodes and integrated circuits, and associated passive electrical components and interconnection technologies.

zinc-refining=Research new ways to refine zinc.

alloys=Combining different metals may result in a useful alloy.
titanium=Titanium is a lustrous transition metal with a silver color, low density and high strength.

ci-chemistry=Chemistry is a branch of physical science that studies the composition, structure, properties and change of matter.
